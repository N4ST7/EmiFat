             <p class="txt">
                Haii Emiii its finally february 3..ðŸ˜­ I've been waiting for this day since last year. Now its time you really need to know about something and express all my thoughts and my feelings about you. 


                I really like you. You're so beautiful and I really love your personality. You already know how much I adore you and how I care about you. I know that you have probably heard those compliments a lot from other people. 
                I just have this feeling whenever im with you or whenever I think of you. You make me really happy. I feel comfortable being with you. I just really love spending time with you. I'm a very clingy person ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ 
                but aahh you are so cutee like actually very cuteeee the small things you doðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,  
                (specially when you snoreðŸ’€ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­jokeee â™¥) HAHAHAHHA I know I keep saying that your so cute but you really are.. and I wont stop calling you cute mwhehe. I might not know really much about you but I really love everything about you your so just fucking prettyyy iaujwdnpiuawdn BEAUTIFUL NO JOKE LIKE BRO IOUANWDPIUAD I CANT EVEN DO THISðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ AND YOUR SO CUTEEEE I WANNA FUCKING SQUEEEZEEEE YOUUUUUUU AHAHAHHA I swear...If ever theres a chance for us to see each otherr im gonna hug you so tight ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ im sorry... I dont know I just dont 
                feel like i know you that 
                well right now, thats why I wanna be with you because i wanna get to know you more. I wanna know everything about you I like youuuu so muchhhh ekdn3idj8ehfiehr... But uh what I'm really tryna say is... 
                (Read till the end...ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­) 
                I know its your first time AND its online or long distance. You might not know about all the relationship stuff you might not be mature or what to do, but thats totally okay. Im here for you I can help you, and maybe you can help me too. 
                We will grow together and mature together from afar, help each other. I may not be the best with relationships too, because honestly I get jealous so quickly like i really get jealous jealous jelaousjelaoususus crazy.. ðŸ˜­
                even the little things makes me jealouss likeeee.. yeahh :DD ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ but its okayyyy dww im trying to fix myself too tryna be a better person too ykðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­I also could be stupid or confusing sometimes but yeah please try to understand my feelings too : D 
                Emi im not trying to force you to like me back or anything, but before you answer you must know there will be a lot of problems and its difficult.. I mean if we get used to it and yk talk about it and just help each other
                but thats okay because thats normal to a relationship, 
                thats how we build our love or relationship together. We might not be even talking for days just because we argued or we might not be in a call for days because we fought or argued something. Could be just a 
                misunderstanding you know. 
                We already had this type of experience or problem and we weren't even together yetðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. and it was already scaring me because I didnt wanna hurt you in the beginning you know.. Theres gonna be times like that. 
                Im not saying we will always have problems or argue or blah blah blahhh, but its expected 
                cause yeah like I said its normal and thats how we slowly build our relationship, trust, and love. I know its really hard for you to open up right now but I really hope you will be able to talk to me 100% 
                comfortably to me I really want you to talk more to me I really love it when you talk to me first because it just makes me feel like your thinking of meðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­, and you know its ALWAYS ME talking to you first huhuhu I 
                always hesitate everytime I talk first because I keep thinking that what if im annoying you or maybe you dont wanna talk to me. Oqneoendiejei huhuhu so please dont be shy to talk to me first DONT EVER THINK THAT YOU 
                WILL DISTURB ME OR ANNOY ME BECAUSE YOU NEVER WILL. Because honestly  if you talk to me first it really makes me happy and it just changes my mood right away. Imagine seeing a notification from you omggg wodniejrirðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ it 
                brightens my day hehehehehhehehehhehe.ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ But listen.. what im really worried about is YOU cause I dont know if you really wanna do this like be with me or like me, I keep overthinking that maybe you are just saying you 
                like me just cause you like me for no reason.. LIKE i just think ur just saying u like me cause why not...ðŸ˜­ but yeah like i said im just overthinking. And another thing is you will probably get bored of me soonðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ because 
                im telling you Emi since its long distance relationship we cant really see each other you know its gonna be hard and WHAT I REALLY WORRY IS. You will probably find someone.. someome who you will like in person. Someone 
                who is better than me.. Let's be honest Emi im not really equal to your standard's :'] Sometimes I just feel like im not good enough for you.. no actually I worry I just dont think I'd be good for you owndoejdiejdijeid or
                or maybe im just a bad influence to you and yk idkkk apiujwbdiauwd OR 
                to your FAMILY im scared.... I'm scared what ur family will think of me wrctpdkecnie and I don't even know what I can do but im not giving up just because of that im gonna try my best to give your family or mainly to you parents
                that I can be responsible, good person, productive, idkkk but you knoww something like that, you know what I mean huhuhuuhhuhu. Im sorry about this long message emi, you probably have a lot in ur mind right now im sorry I just 
                really like you owndo3jididoeifjrjriffneis that I had to make this long message for you to understand you know..
                and I'm really tryna be cautious with who I wanna be because when I fall in love or like someone and when I'm really into them. Then that simply means IM REALLY INTO YOU LIKE I WANNA BE WITH YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFEðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ 
                I love you Emi. WHEN I SAY "I LOVE YOU" WHAT I MEAN IS I love that one and only special girl and hope to make her my wife someday...ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­(yeah... I know very cringe but.. its true ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­) im really serious about 
                this im not joking ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I love to wife. I just dont play around, I wait for the right person ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­, 
                I always think about the future so I can think about what to do and make some plans in the future right now im tryna figure out how to get a steady life when i get older soon so I can fly to youðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. 
                I'm only waiting for the right person, and maybe it could be you or maybe not...ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ BUT I REALLY HOPE SO. I dont know... I just really hope you you feel the same way for meðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. 
                We dont really know about the future but yeah. If your not really ready yet for a relationship OR you just dont like me that much, please just tell me now if  you dont so its gonna less painful for me if you say it now. 
                I know its hard for you to tell me but atleast be brave for this part be honest cause i dont really wanna get played. Im not saying you are, im just saying that maybe your not ready yet or smthh you know huhu or maybe you need more time to think about it. 
                And if you really dont. Then damn i got nothing to say.ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ imma cry jokeðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜­. If you really arent ready for all of this or maybe you just dont wanna do this just tell me. I dont wanna lose you Emi, atleast be my 
                friend 
                still if u cant do it. I'll be your friend and always be there for you. Im sorry for this shitty ass long message, its probably giving your brain a critical damageðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. Honestly... I think this message is just too longgg ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ 
                its too crazy.. But uhh yeahh it's okay Emi I understand please take your time to think, no rush at all. I Hope you dont feel uncomfortable or feel any different about me after this.ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I'll be waiting.
